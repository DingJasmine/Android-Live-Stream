# Android-Live-Stream
## Abstract
For the prosperity of live streaming, more and more various display is needed. Therefore, there are diversified platforms for live streaming. However, all these platforms only provide single-view display and makes the change of camera a very fussy procedure. To give the anchors a more satisfied experience and meet their demand, this project aims at providing a multi-view display on Android devices. Multiple UVCCameras can be accessed in the live streaming room, while anchors can choose a certain cameraâ€™s view as the main view. Filters, audio wave and camera manager are provided in the room at the same time to convenient the anchor. The external accessed UVCCameras also meet the need of high revolution. The platform was built as an Android application using the MVC framework and is compatible with Android-based mobile devices.
